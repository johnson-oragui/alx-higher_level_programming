JavaScript web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites using JavaScript code. Web scraping allows you to programmatically access and gather data from web pages, which can be useful for various purposes, such as data analysis, research, or building applications that rely on external data sources.

Web scraping with JavaScript is typically done by making HTTP requests to the target website, retrieving the HTML content, and then parsing and extracting the relevant information from the page.
